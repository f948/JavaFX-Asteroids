# JavaFX-Asteroids 

Description: A remake of the classic 1978 game "Asteroids", in which a player will try to shoot asteroids on the screen to avoid being hit by them and avoid the resulting debris from the shot asteroid. When an asteroid is hit it will split into two asteroids half the size of the original asteroid that will travel in random directions.
